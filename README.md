**Plugin Architecture**

The SuperAGI plugin to send messages with attachments and images to a Discord channel will consist of the following main classes and functions:

1. `DiscordClient`: This class will handle the communication with the Discord API and provide methods to send messages with attachments and images to a specified channel.

2. `Message`: This class will represent a message to be sent to Discord and will contain the necessary information such as content, attachments, and images.

3. `Attachment`: This class will represent an attachment to be included in a message and will contain the necessary information such as file name and file data.

4. `Image`: This class will represent an image to be included in a message and will contain the necessary information such as file name and file data.

5. `send_message`: This function will be the entry point of the plugin and will be responsible for creating a `DiscordClient` instance, constructing a `Message` object, and sending the message to the specified Discord channel.

Now, let's dive into the implementation of each file.
